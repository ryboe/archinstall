# archinstall

This is an Arch Linux installer I made for my desktop computer. It's design borrows heavily from [variadico/xpslinux](https://github.com/variadico/xpslinux). It's made for a machine with these specs:
* Coffee Lake 8700K CPU
* Integrated GPU
* ASUS STRIX Z370-G motherboard
* Intel 900P Optane SSD

I don't recommend using it unless you're me. It might make your computer unbootable.
